# A MERN Authentication System

A **secure authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** that implements modern authentication practices. This project provides a solid foundation for user authentication and authorization in full-stack web applications.

It focuses on security, scalability, and clean architecture, making it suitable for real-world applications and production-ready systems.

##  Key Features

-  User Registration & Login
-  Secure password hashing
-  JWT-based authentication
-  Protected routes (authorization)
-  Logout functionality
-  Modular and scalable project structure
-  RESTful API design

---

##  Authentication Flow

1. User registers with email and password  
2. Password is securely hashed and stored in MongoDB  
3. On login, credentials are verified  
4. JWT token is generated and sent to the client  
5. Protected routes validate JWT for secure access

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
- **Security:** bcrypt  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **implement a secure, scalable authentication system** using the MERN stack while following best practices for password security, API design, and authorization handling.

---

##  Learning Outcomes

* Full-stack authentication implementation
* Secure password handling with bcrypt
* Token-based authentication using JWT
* Middleware-based route protection
* Clean separation of frontend and backend concerns

---

##  Future Enhancements

*  Refresh token implementation
*  Role-based access control (RBAC)
*  Email verification & password reset
*  OAuth (Google/GitHub login)
*  Improved UI & UX
